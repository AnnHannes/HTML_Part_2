    <h1>HAIKU</h1>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>The haiku is a form of Japanese poetry, written in three lines of which the first line has 5, the second line 7 and the third line has 5 syllables. In its classical form, the haiku expresses a momentary experience, sometimes linked to and inspired by Zen. The haiku is a thimble full of emotion, in which there is little room for dissections and approximate descriptions.</p>
